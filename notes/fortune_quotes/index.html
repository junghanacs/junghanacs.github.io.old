<details ><summary>Details</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <p>%
Learn how to learn from those you disagree with, or even offend you. See if you can find the truth in what they believe.</p>
<ul>
<li>당신이 동의하지 않거나, 심지어 당신을 기분 상하게 하는 사람에게서도 배우는 방법을 익히세요. 그들이 믿는 것에서 진실을 찾을 수 있는지 보세요.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points.</p>
<ul>
<li>열정적인 것은 IQ 25 의 가치가 있습니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different. Different is better.</p>
<ul>
<li>항상 데드라인을 요구하세요. 데드라인은 관계없거나 평범한 것들을 제거합니다. 데드라인이 &ldquo;완벽하게&rdquo; 만들지 못하게 방해해주니까, &ldquo;다르게&rdquo; 만들어야 합니다. 다른 것이 좋습니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Don’t be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99%  of the time everyone else is thinking of the same question and is too embarrassed to ask it.</p>
<ul>
<li>99%의 사람들은 같은 질문을 생각하니까, 멍청한 질문이라고 생각되는 것이라도 두려워하지 마세요.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Being able to listen well is a superpower. While listening to someone you love keep asking them “Is there more?”, until there is no more.</p>
<ul>
<li>잘 들을 수 있는 것은 초능력입니다. 당신이 좋아하는 사람의 말을 들을 때, 그 사람이 더 말할 게 없을 때까지 &ldquo;더 없어?&ldquo;라고 물어보세요.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
A worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you can’t believe how ignorant you were a year earlier.</p>
<ul>
<li>한해동안 가치 있을 만한 목표는 &ldquo;1 년 전에는 어쩜 이걸 몰랐을까?&rdquo; 싶은 주제에 대해 배우는 것입니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Gratitude will unlock all other virtues and is something you can get better at.</p>
<ul>
<li>감사하는 것은 다른 모든 미덕의 시작이며, 당신이 더 나아지도록 합니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Treating a person to a meal never fails, and is so easy to do. It’s powerful with old friends and a great way to make new friends.</p>
<ul>
<li>사람들에게 식사를 대접하는 것은 실행하기도 쉽고 절대 실패하지 않습니다. 오랜 친구에게도 강력하고 새로운 친구를 사귀기에도 좋은 방법입니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Don’t trust all-purpose glue.</p>
<ul>
<li>다목적 접착제는 믿지 마세요</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Reading to your children regularly will bond you together and kickstart their imaginations.</p>
<ul>
<li>아이들에게 정기적으로 책을 읽어주면 당신과 끈끈해지고 상상력을 길러줄 수 있습니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Never use a credit card for credit. The only kind of credit, or debt, that is acceptable is debt to acquire something whose exchange value is extremely likely to increase, like in a home. The exchange value of most things diminishes or vanishes the moment you purchase them. Don’t be in debt to losers.</p>
<ul>
<li>신용카드를 사용하지 마세요. 허용 가능한 유일한 부채는 &lsquo;집&rsquo;처럼 가격이 끝내는 오를만한 것을 사려고 할 때뿐입니다. 대부분 물건의 가치는 구입순간부터 감소하거나 사라집니다. 빚지지 마세요.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Pros are just amateurs who know how to gracefully recover from their mistakes.</p>
<ul>
<li>전문가(Pro)는 실수로부터 우아하게 회복할 방법을 아는 아마추어일 뿐입니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Extraordinary claims should require extraordinary evidence to be believed.</p>
<ul>
<li>특별한 주장은 믿을만한 특별한 증거를 요구하는 게 좋습니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Don’t be the smartest person in the room. Hangout with, and learn from, people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you.</p>
<ul>
<li>방에서 가장 똑똑한 사람이 되지 마세요. 자신보다 더 똑똑한 사람들과 만나고 배우세요. 더 나아가 당신에게 동의하지 않는 똑똑한 사람들을 찾으세요.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Rule of 3 in conversation. To get to the real reason, ask a person to go deeper than what they just said. Then again, and once more. The third time’s answer is close to the truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>대화에서의 3 의 법칙. 진짜 이유를 들으려면 누군가가 말한 것에 대해 좀 더 깊이 얘기해 달라고 하세요. 그리고 한번, 다시 한번 더. 세번째 대답이 진실에 가깝습니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Don’t be the best. Be the only.</p>
<ul>
<li>최고가 되지 말고, 유일한 사람이 되세요.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them, they are waiting for you to send them an email, they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead.</p>
<ul>
<li>모두 부끄러워합니다. 다른 사람들은 당신이 자신을 소개해주기를, 이메일을 보내주기를, 데이트를 요청해주기를 기다리고 있어요. 지금 실행하세요.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Don’t take it personally when someone turns you down. Assume they are like you: busy, occupied, distracted. Try again later. It’s amazing how often a second try works.</p>
<ul>
<li>누군가 당신을 거절할 때 그걸 개인적으로 받아들이지 마세요. 그들도 당신과 같다고 생각하세요. 바쁘고, 뭔가에 점유되어 있고, 산만합니다. 나중에 다시 시도하세요. 두 번째 시도가 얼마나 잘 성공하는지 놀라실걸요.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it. Good habits can range from telling the truth, to flossing.</p>
<ul>
<li>습관의 목적은 자기 자신과 타협하는 행동을 제거하는 것입니다. 할지 말지 고민하는 데 에너지를 쓰지 마세요. 그냥 하세요. 좋은 습관은 진실을 말하는 것부터 치실(flossing)을 하는 것까지 다양합니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Promptness is a sign of respect.</p>
<ul>
<li>신속함은 존중의 표시입니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
When you are young spend at least 6 months to one year living as poor as you can, owning as little as you possibly can, eating beans and rice in a tiny room or tent, to experience what your “worst” lifestyle might be. That way any time you have to risk something in the future you won’t be afraid of the worst case scenario.</p>
<ul>
<li>젊었을 때 가능하다면 적어도 6 개월에서 1 년까지 아주 작은 방이나 텐트에서 콩과 쌀만 먹으며 빈곤하게 생활해보세요. &ldquo;가장 나쁜&rdquo; 생활이 어떨지 한번 경험해보세요. 그러면 미래에 뭔가 위험을 감수해야 할 때, 최악의 시나리오를 두려워하지 않을 것입니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Trust me: There is no “them”.</p>
<ul>
<li>저를 믿으세요: &ldquo;그들&quot;이란 건 없습니다. (역주: 뭔가 내 의견에 반하는 &lsquo;사람들&rsquo;이 있는게 아니고 우린 모두 다른 의견을 가진 거라고 생각하고 번역했습니다.)</li>
</ul>
<p>%
The more you are interested in others, the more interesting they find you. To be interesting, be interested.</p>
<ul>
<li>다른 사람들에게 관심을 가질수록, 다른 사람들도 당신에게 흥미를 느끼게 됩니다. 흥미로워지려면 관심을 가지세요.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Optimize your generosity. No one on their deathbed has ever regretted giving too much away.</p>
<ul>
<li>관대함을 최적화하세요. 죽을 때 너무 많이 나눠줬다고 후회하는 사람은 없습니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
To make something good, just do it. To make something great, just re-do it, re-do it, re-do it. The secret to making fine things is in remaking them.</p>
<ul>
<li>좋은 것을 만들려면 그냥 하세요. 위대한 것을 만들려면 다시 하고, 다시 하고, 다시 하세요. 훌륭한 것을 만드는 비결은 다시 만들어 보는 것입니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
The Golden Rule will never fail you. It is the foundation of all other virtues.</p>
<ul>
<li>황금률 (The Golden Rule, 다른 사람이 해 주었으면 하는 행위를 하라 [1])은 절대 실망하게 하지 않습니다. 그것은 다른 모든 미덕의 기초입니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
If you are looking for something in your house, and you finally find it, when you’re done with it, don’t put it back where you found it. Put it back where you first looked for it.</p>
<ul>
<li>집에서 뭔가를 찾고 있을 때 마침내 찾았다면 그 자리에 다시 두지 말고, 맨 처음 찾아봤던 곳에 두세요.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Saving money and investing money are both good habits. Small amounts of money invested regularly for many decades without deliberation is one path to wealth.</p>
<ul>
<li>돈을 절약하고 투자하는것은 좋은 습관입니다. 아주 깊이 생각지 않고, 수십년간 소량의 돈을 정기적으로 투자하는 것은 부자가 되는 방법중 하나 입니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
To make mistakes is human. To own your mistakes is divine. Nothing elevates a person higher than quickly admitting and taking personal responsibility for the mistakes you make and then fixing them fairly. If you mess up, fess up. It’s astounding how powerful this ownership is.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>실수를 하는 것이 인간입니다. 당신이 실수한다는 것은 매우 신성한 것입니다. 자신이 저지른 실수에 대해 신속하게 인정하고, 공정하게 바로 잡는것 보다 사람을 훌륭하게 만들어주는 것은 없습니다. 뭔가를 망쳤다면, 털어 놓으세요. 이 &ldquo;실수에 대한 소유권&quot;이 얼마나 강력한지 놀랄겁니다.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never get involved in a land war in Asia ( 아시아에서 내전에 관여하지 마십시오 = 분에 넘치는 일은 하지 마세요 )</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>( 역주: 몽고메리/맥아더가 썻다고 알려진 표현 입니다. 주석에 링크 달겠습니다 [2] )</p>
<p>%
You can obsess about serving your customers/audience/clients, or you can obsess about beating the competition. Both work, but of the two, obsessing about your customers will take you further.</p>
<ul>
<li>고객/청중/사용자에게 집중하거나, 경쟁에서 이기는 것에 집중할 수 있습니다. 두가지 다 동작하지만, 고객에 집중하는 것이 더 멀리 갈 수 있습니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Show up. Keep showing up. Somebody successful said: 99%
of success is just showing up.</p>
<ul>
<li>보여주세요. 뭔가를 계속 보여주세요. 성공한 사람이 말하길: 99%</li>
</ul>
<p>의 성공은 그저 보여주는 것입니다. ( 역주: Show up 은 뭔가를 만들어서 보여주는 것, 어딘가에 참석해서 보여주는 것 의 의미도 있지만 [3]의 글을 참고하시면 뭔가를 시작하는 것으로도 이해할수 있습니다. 헬스장에 등록하고 가는 것도 시작, 매일 글을 쓰는 것, 수업에 참석하는 것, 프로젝트에 참여하는 등 뭔가를 시작하는 것을 보여주는 것이라고 이해하면 될 것 같습니다.)</p>
<p>%
Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgement.</p>
<ul>
<li>창작과 개선과정을 분리하세요. 쓰는것과 편집하는것, 조각하고 다듬는 것, 만들고 분석하는 것을 동시에 할수는 없습니다. 동시에 한다면 내 안의 편집자가 창작자를 막게 됩니다. 발명하는 동안 선택하지 마세요. 스케치 하는동안 검사하지 마세요. 초안 작성중에는 반영하지 마세요. 처음에는 창작자의 마음이 판단으로부터 해방되어야 합니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
If you are not falling down occasionally, you are just coasting.</p>
<ul>
<li>당신이 가끔 쓰러지지 않는다면, 설렁 설렁하고 있는 것입니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Perhaps the most counter-intuitive truth of the universe is that the more you give to others, the more you’ll get. Understanding this is the beginning of wisdom.</p>
<ul>
<li>아마도 우주의 진리중 가장 반직관적인 것은 &ldquo;남에게 더 많이 줄수록, 더 많이 얻게 된다는 것&rdquo; 입니다. 이것을 이해하는 것이 지혜의 시작입니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Friends are better than money. Almost anything money can do, friends can do better. In so many ways a friend with a boat is better than owning a boat.</p>
<ul>
<li>친구가 돈보다 낫습니다. 돈이 할 수 있는 거의 모든 것은, 대부분 친구들이 더 잘합니다. 여러가지면에서 배를 소유하는 것보다, 배를 가진 친구가 낫습니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
This is true: It’s hard to cheat an honest man.</p>
<ul>
<li>분명한 사실: 정직한 사람을 속이는 것은 어렵습니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
When an object is lost, 95% of the time it is hiding within arm’s reach of where it was last seen. Search in all possible locations in that radius and you’ll find it.</p>
<ul>
<li>물건을 잃어버렸을 때, 95%는 마지막으로 본 곳에서 팔 닿는곳에 있습니다. 해당 반경내에서 모든 곳을 뒤져보면 찾을수 있습니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
You are what you do. Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on.</p>
<ul>
<li>당신은 당신이 하는 일로 표현됩니다. 당신이 하는 말이 아니라, 믿는 것이 아니라, 투표하는 방식이 아니라, 당신이 시간을 쓰는 그 것이 당신을 말해줍니다.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
If you lose or forget to bring a cable, adapter or charger, check with your hotel. Most hotels now have a drawer full of cables, adapters and chargers others have left behind, and probably have the one you are missing. You can often claim it after borrowing it.</p>
<ul>
<li>케이블,어댑터,충전기를 잃어버리거나 안 가져왔을 때 호텔에 문의하세요. 대부분의 호텔은 누군가 놓고간 케이블, 어댑터 및 충전기로 가득찬 서랍을 가지고 있을겁니다. 당신이 잃어버린게 거기 있을지도 몰라요.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
Hatred is a curse that does not affect the hated. It only poisons the hater. Release a grudge as if it was a poison.</p>
<ul>
<li>증오는 미움 받는 사람(the hated)에게는 영향을 주지 않는 저주입니다. 증오하는 본인(the hater)만 아프게 하는 독약과 같습니다. 독약인 것 처럼 원한을 놓아버리세요.</li>
</ul>
<p>%
There is no limit on better. Talent is distributed unfairly, but there is no limit on how much we can improve what we start with.</p>
<ul>
<li>더 잘 하는 것 (better) 에는 제한이 없습니다. 재능은 불공평하게 분배되지만, 우리가 가지고 시작한 것을 얼마나 향상시킬 수 있는지는 제한이 없습니다.</li>

Rule of 7 in research. You can find out anything if you are willing to go seven levels. If the first source you ask doesn’t know, ask them who you should ask next, and so on down the line. If you are willing to go to the 7th source, you’ll almost always get your answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>조사할 때 7 의 법칙. 7 단계를 갈 수 있다면 무엇이든 찾을 수 있습니다. 첫번째 물어본 사람이 모르면, 그 사람에게 다음으로 누구한테 물어야 할지를 물어보고 계속 하세요. 7 번째 까지 가려고 할때면 거의 항상 답을 얻을 것입니다.</li>

Following your bliss is a recipe for paralysis if you don’t know what you are passionate about. A better motto for most youth is “master something, anything”.

<ul>
<li>어떤 것에 열정을 가지고 있는지 모른 체 단순히 행복만을 좇다␜보면 무기력해지게 됩니다. 많은 젊은이들을 위한 좀 더 좋은 모토는 &ldquo;뭔가를 마스터하세요. 어떤것이라도&rdquo; 입니다. 한 가지 숙달하는 것을 통해서 더 큰 기쁨을 주는 다른 것으로 확장해 갈 수 있고, 결국엔 행복이 어디에 있는지 알게 됩니다.</li>

Money is overrated. Truly new things rarely need an abundance of money. If that was so, billionaires would have a monopoly on inventing new things, and they don’t.

The people I’ve met who do great work… generally feel that they’re stupid and

only a matter of time until they’re found out.</p>

What they really mean is, don’t get demoralized. Don’t think that you can’t do
what other people can. And I agree you shouldn’t underestimate your potential.
People who’ve done great things tend to seem as if they were a race apart. And
most biographies only exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful
attitude biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how the
story ends, they can’t help streamlining the plot till it seems like the
subject’s life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding of some innate
genius. In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen year old Shakespeare or
Einstein in school with you, they’d seem impressive, but not totally unlike
your other friends.</p>

It could be that in Java’s case I’m mistaken. It could be that a language
promoted by one big company to undermine another, designed by a committee for
a “mainstream” audience, hyped to the skies, and beloved of the DoD [=
“Department of Defense”], happens nonetheless to be a clean, beautiful,
powerful language that I would love programming in. It could be, but it seems
very unlikely.</p>

But for what it’s worth, as a sort of time capsule, here’s why I don’t like
the look of Java:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has been so energetically hyped. Real standards don’t have to be</li>
</ol>
<p>promoted. No one had to promote C, or Unix, or HTML. A real standard tends to
be already established by the time most people hear about it. On the hacker
radar screen, Perl is as big as Java, or bigger, just on the strength of its
own merits.</p>

Bundling all these different types of work together in one department may be
convenient administratively, but it’s confusing intellectually. That’s the
other reason I don’t like the name “computer science.” Arguably the people in
the middle are doing something like an experimental science. But the people at
either end, the hackers and the mathematicians, are not actually doing
science.</p>
<p>The mathematicians don’t seem bothered by this. They happily set to work
proving theorems like the other mathematicians over in the math department,
and probably soon stop noticing that the building they work in says “computer
science” on the outside. But for the hackers this label is a problem. If what
they’re doing is called science, it makes them feel they ought to be acting
scientific. So instead of doing what they really want to do, which is to
design beautiful software, hackers in universities and research labs feel they
ought to be writing research papers.</p>

<p>%
For example, I was taught in college that one ought to figure out a program
completely on paper before even going near a computer. I found that I did not
program this way. I found that I liked to program sitting in front of a
computer, not a piece of paper. Worse still, instead of patiently writing out
a complete program and assuring myself it was correct, I tended to just spew
out code that was hopelessly broken, and gradually beat it into shape.
Debugging, I was taught, was a kind of final pass where you caught typos and
oversights. The way I worked, it seemed like programming consisted of
debugging.</p>
<p>For a long time I felt bad about this, just as I once felt bad that I didn’t
hold my pencil the way they taught me to in elementary school. If I had only
looked over at the other makers, the painters or the architects, I would have
realized that there was a name for what I was doing: sketching. As far as I
can tell, the way they taught me to program in college was all wrong. You
should figure out programs as you’re writing them, just as writers and
painters and architects do.</p>

&ndash; Hackers and Painters (

<p>%
I only discovered this myself quite recently. When Yahoo bought Viaweb, they
asked me what I wanted to do. I had never liked the business side very much,
and said that I just wanted to hack. When I got to Yahoo, I found that what
hacking meant to them was implementing software, not designing it. Programmers
were seen as technicians who translated the visions (if that is the word) of
product managers into code.</p>
<p>This seems to be the default plan in big companies. They do it because it
decreases the standard deviation of the outcome. Only a small percentage of
hackers can actually design software, and it’s hard for the people running a
company to pick these out. So instead of entrusting the future of the software
to one brilliant hacker, most companies set things up so that it is designed
by committee, and the hackers merely implement the design.</p>
<p>If you want to make money at some point, remember this, because this is one of
the reasons startups win. Big companies want to decrease the standard
deviation of design outcomes because they want to avoid disasters. But when
you damp oscillations, you lose the high points as well as the low. This is
not a problem for big companies, because they don’t win by making great
products. Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies.</p>

It’s not true that those who can’t do, teach (some of the best hackers I know
are professors), but it is true that there are a lot of things that those who
teach can’t do. Research imposes constraining caste restrictions. In any
academic field there are topics that are ok to work on and others that aren’t.
Unfortunately the distinction between acceptable and forbidden topics is
usually based on how intellectual the work sounds when described in research
papers, rather than how important it is for getting good results. The extreme
case is probably literature; people studying literature rarely say anything
that would be of the slightest use to those producing it.</p>
<p>Though the situation is better in the sciences, the overlap between the kind
of work you’re allowed to do and the kind of work that yields good languages
is distressingly small. (Olin Shivers has grumbled eloquently about this.) For
example, types seem to be an inexhaustible source of research papers, despite
the fact that static typing seems to preclude true macros&ndash; without which, in
my opinion, no language is worth using.</p>

<p>%
To the popular press, “hacker” means someone who breaks into computers. Among
programmers it means a good programmer. But the two meanings are connected. To
programmers, “hacker” connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone who
can make a computer do what he wants&ndash; whether the computer wants to or not.</p>
<p>To add to the confusion, the noun “hack” also has two senses. It can be either
a compliment or an insult. It’s called a hack when you do something in an ugly
way. But when you do something so clever that you somehow beat the system,
that’s also called a hack. The word is used more often in the former than the
latter sense, probably because ugly solutions are more common than brilliant
ones.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the two senses of “hack” are also connected. Ugly and
imaginative solutions have something in common: they both break the rules. And
there is a gradual continuum between rule breaking that’s merely ugly (using
duct tape to attach something to your bike) and rule breaking that is
brilliantly imaginative (discarding Euclidean space).</p>

Hacking predates computers. When he was working on the Manhattan Project,
Richard Feynman used to amuse himself by breaking into safes containing secret
documents. This tradition continues today. When we were in grad school, a
hacker friend of mine who spent too much time around MIT had his own lock
picking kit. (He now runs a hedge fund, a not unrelated enterprise.)</p>
<p>It is sometimes hard to explain to authorities why one would want to do such
things. Another friend of mine once got in trouble with the government for
breaking into computers. This had only recently been declared a crime, and the
FBI found that their usual investigative technique didn’t work. Police
investigation apparently begins with a motive. The usual motives are few:
drugs, money, sex, revenge. Intellectual curiosity was not one of the motives
on the FBI’s list. Indeed, the whole concept seemed foreign to them.</p>

When you read what the founding fathers had to say for themselves, they sound
more like hackers. “The spirit of resistance to government,” Jefferson wrote,
“is so valuable on certain occasions, that I wish it always to be kept alive.”</p>
<p>Imagine an American president saying that today. Like the remarks of an
outspoken old grandmother, the sayings of the founding fathers have
embarrassed generations of their less confident successors. They remind us
where we come from. They remind us that it is the people who break rules that
are the source of America’s wealth and power.</p>
<p>Those in a position to impose rules naturally want them to be obeyed. But be
careful what you ask for. You might get it.</p>

If you work your way down the Forbes 400 making an x next to the name of each
person with an MBA, you’ll learn something important about business school.
You don’t even hit an MBA till number 22, Phil Knight, the CEO of Nike. There
are only four MBAs in the top 50. What you notice in the Forbes 400 are a lot
of people with technical backgrounds. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison,
Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore. The rulers of the technology business
tend to come from technology, not business. So if you want to invest two years
in something that will help you succeed in business, the evidence suggests
you’d do better to learn how to hack than get an MBA.</p>

The aphorism “you can’t tell a book by its cover” originated in the times when
books were sold in plain cardboard covers, to be bound by each purchaser
according to his own taste. In those days, you couldn’t tell a book by its
cover. But publishing has advanced since then: present-day publishers work
hard to make the cover something you can tell a book by.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time in bookshops and I feel as if I have by now learned to
understand everything publishers mean to tell me about a book, and perhaps a
bit more. The time I haven’t spent in bookshops I’ve spent mostly in front of
computers, and I feel as if I’ve learned, to some degree, to judge technology
by its cover as well. It may be just luck, but I’ve saved myself from a few
technologies that turned out to be real stinkers.</p>

<li>It’s aimed low. In the original Java white paper, Gosling explicitly says</li>
</ol>
<p>Java was designed not to be too difficult for programmers used to C. It was
designed to be another C++: C plus a few ideas taken from more advanced
languages. Like the creators of sitcoms or junk food or package tours, Java’s
designers were consciously designing a product for people not as smart as
them. Historically, languages designed for other people to use have been bad:
Cobol, PL/I, Pascal, Ada, C++. The good languages have been those that were
designed for their own creators: C, Perl, Smalltalk, Lisp.</p>

The wrong people like it. The programmers I admire most are not, on the whole,
captivated by Java. Who does like Java? Suits, who don’t know one language
from another, but know that they keep hearing about Java in the press;
programmers at big companies, who are amazed to find that there is something
even better than C++; and plug-and-chug undergrads, who are ready to like
anything that might get them a job (will this be on the test?). These people’s
opinions change with every wind.</p>

Let’s start by acknowledging one external factor that does affect the
popularity of a programming language. To become popular, a programming
language has to be the scripting language of a popular system. Fortran and
Cobol were the scripting languages of early IBM mainframes. C was the
scripting language of Unix, and so, later, was Perl. Tcl is the scripting
language of Tk. Java and JavaScript are intended to be the scripting languages
of web browsers.</p>
<p>Lisp is not a massively popular language because it is not the scripting
language of a massively popular system. What popularity it retains dates back
to the 1960s and 1970s, when it was the scripting language of MIT. A lot of
the great programmers of the day were associated with MIT at some point. And
in the early 1970s, before C, MIT’s dialect of Lisp, called MacLisp, was one
of the only programming languages a serious hacker would want to use.</p>
<p>&ndash; Paul Graham
&ndash; Being Popular ( 
  <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html</a> )</p>
<p>%
One thing hackers like is brevity. Hackers are lazy, in the same way that
mathematicians and modernist architects are lazy: they hate anything
extraneous. It would not be far from the truth to say that a hacker about to
write a program decides what language to use, at least subconsciously, based
on the total number of characters he’ll have to type. If this isn’t precisely
how hackers think, a language designer would do well to act as if it were.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to try to baby the user with long-winded expressions that are
meant to resemble English. Cobol is notorious for this flaw. A hacker would
consider being asked to write</p>
<p>add x to y giving z</p>
<p>instead of</p>
<p>z = x+y</p>
<p>as something between an insult to his intelligence and a sin against God.</p>
<p>&ndash; Paul Graham
&ndash; Being Popular ( 
  <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html</a> )</p>
<p>%
I think that, like species, languages will form evolutionary trees, with
dead-ends branching off all over. We can see this happening already. Cobol,
for all its sometime popularity, does not seem to have any intellectual
descendants. It is an evolutionary dead-end&ndash; a Neanderthal language.</p>
<p>I predict a similar fate for Java. People sometimes send me mail saying, “How
can you say that Java won’t turn out to be a successful language? It’s already
a successful language.” And I admit that it is, if you measure success by
shelf space taken up by books on it (particularly individual books on it), or
by the number of undergrads who believe they have to learn it to get a job.
When I say Java won’t turn out to be a successful language, I mean something
more specific: that Java will turn out to be an evolutionary dead-end, like
Cobol.</p>
<p>This is just a guess. I may be wrong. My point here is not to dis Java, but to
raise the issue of evolutionary trees and get people asking, where on the tree
is language X? The reason to ask this question isn’t just so that our ghosts
can say, in a hundred years, I told you so. It’s because staying close to the
main branches is a useful heuristic for finding languages that will be good to
program in now.</p>

This isn’t just something that happens with programming languages. It’s a
general historical trend. As technologies improve, each generation can do
things that the previous generation would have considered wasteful. People
thirty years ago would be astonished at how casually we make long distance
phone calls. People a hundred years ago would be even more astonished that a
package would one day travel from Boston to New York via Memphis.</p>

In the discussion about issues raised by Revenge of the Nerds on the LL1
mailing list, Paul Prescod wrote something that stuck in my mind.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Python’s goal is regularity and readability, not succinctness</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>On the face of it, this seems a rather damning thing to claim about a
programming language. As far as I can tell, succinctness = power. If so, then
substituting, we get</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Python’s goal is regularity and readability, not power.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>and this doesn’t seem a tradeoff (if it is a tradeoff) that you’d want to
make. It’s not far from saying that Python’s goal is not to be effective as a
programming language.</p>

Bureaucrats by their nature are the exact opposite sort of people from startup

&ndash; How to Be Silicon Valley ( 
  <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html">http://www.paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html</a> )</p>
<p>%
If you go to see Silicon Valley, what you’ll see are buildings. But it’s the
people that make it Silicon Valley, not the buildings. I read occasionally
about attempts to set up “technology parks” in other places, as if the active
ingredient of Silicon Valley were the office space. An article about Sophia
Antipolis bragged that companies there included Cisco, Compaq, IBM, NCR, and
Nortel. Don’t the French realize these aren’t startups?</p>
<p>Building office buildings for technology companies won’t get you a silicon
valley, because the key stage in the life of a startup happens before they
want that kind of space. The key stage is when they’re three guys operating
out of an apartment. Wherever the startup is when it gets funded, it will
stay. The defining quality of Silicon Valley is not that Intel or Apple or
Google have offices there, but that they were started there.</p>
<p>So if you want to reproduce Silicon Valley, what you need to reproduce is
those two or three founders sitting around a kitchen table deciding to start a
company. And to reproduce that you need those people.</p>

One of the most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea that doing
great things requires a lot of discipline. Most subjects are taught in such a
boring way that it’s only by discipline that you can flog yourself through
them. So I was surprised when, early in college, I read a quote by
Wittgenstein saying that he had no self-discipline and had never been able to
deny himself anything, not even a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Now I know a number of people who do great work, and it’s the same with all of
them. They have little discipline. They’re all terrible procrastinators and
find it almost impossible to make themselves do anything they’re not
interested in. One still hasn’t sent out his half of the thank-you notes from
his wedding, four years ago. Another has 26,000 emails in her inbox.</p>
<p>I’m not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline. You probably need
about the amount you need to go running. I’m often reluctant to go running,
but once I do, I enjoy it. And if I don’t run for several days, I feel ill.
It’s the same with people who do great things. They know they’ll feel bad if
they don’t work, and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their
desks to start working. But once they get started, interest takes over, and
discipline is no longer necessary.</p>

Your teachers are always telling you to behave like adults. I wonder if they’d
like it if you did. You may be loud and disorganized, but you’re very docile
compared to adults. If you actually started acting like adults, it would be
just as if a bunch of adults had been transposed into your bodies. Imagine the
reaction of an FBI agent or taxi driver or reporter to being told they had to
ask permission to go the bathroom, and only one person could go at a time. To
say nothing of the things you’re taught. If a bunch of actual adults suddenly
found themselves trapped in high school, the first thing they’d do is form a
union and renegotiate all the rules with the administration.</p>

I disagree with your generalization that physicists are smarter than
professors of French Literature.</p>
<p>Try this thought experiment. A dictator takes over the US and sends all the
professors to re-education camps. The physicists are told they have to learn
how to write academic articles about French literature, and the French
literature professors are told they have to learn how to write original
physics papers. If they fail, they’ll be shot. Which group is more worried?</p>
<p>We have some evidence here: the famous parody that physicist Alan Sokal got
published in Social Text. How long did it take him to master the art of
writing deep-sounding nonsense well enough to fool the editors? A couple
weeks?</p>
<p>What do you suppose would be the odds of a literary theorist getting a parody
of a physics paper published in a physics journal?</p>

Imagine, for example, what would happen if the government decided to
commission someone to write an official Great American Novel. First there’d be
a huge ideological squabble over who to choose. Most of the best writers would
be excluded for having offended one side or the other. Of the remainder, the
smart ones would refuse such a job, leaving only a few with the wrong sort of
ambition. The committee would choose one at the height of his career—that is,
someone whose best work was behind him—and hand over the project with copious
free advice about how the book should show in positive terms the strength and
diversity of the American people, etc, etc.</p>
<p>The unfortunate writer would then sit down to work with a huge weight of
expectation on his shoulders. Not wanting to blow such a public commission,
he’d play it safe. This book had better command respect, and the way to ensure
that would be to make it a tragedy. Audiences have to be enticed to laugh, but
if you kill people they feel obliged to take you seriously. As everyone knows,
America plus tragedy equals the Civil War, so that’s what it would have to be
about. Better stick to the standard cartoon version that the Civil War was
about slavery; people would be confused otherwise; plus you can show a lot of
strength and diversity. When finally completed twelve years later, the book
would be a 900-page pastiche of existing popular novels—roughly Gone with the
Wind plus Roots. But its bulk and celebrity would make it a best-seller for a
few months, until blown out of the water by a talk-show host’s autobiography.
The book would be made into a movie and thereupon forgotten, except by the
more waspish sort of reviewers, among whom it would be a byword for bogusness
like Milli Vanilli or Battlefield Earth.</p>
<p>Maybe I got a little carried away with this example. And yet is this not at
each point the way such a project would play out? The government knows better
than to get into the novel business, but in other fields where they have a
natural monopoly, like nuclear waste dumps, aircraft carriers, and regime
change, you’d find plenty of projects isomorphic to this one—and indeed,
plenty that were less successful.</p>

The second big element of Web 2.0 is democracy. We now have several examples
to prove that amateurs can surpass professionals, when they have the right
kind of system to channel their efforts. Wikipedia may be the most famous.
Experts have given Wikipedia middling reviews, but they miss the critical
point: it’s good enough. And it’s free, which means people actually read it.
On the web, articles you have to pay for might as well not exist. Even if you
were willing to pay to read them yourself, you can’t link to them. They’re not
part of the conversation.</p>

And when I read, say, New York Times stories, I never reach them through the
Times front page. Most I find through aggregators like Google News or Slashdot
or Delicious. Aggregators show how much better you can do than the channel.
The New York Times front page is a list of articles written by people who work
for the New York Times. Delicious is a list of articles that are interesting.
And it&rsquo;s only now that you can see the two side by side that you notice how
little overlap there is.</p>
<p>Most articles in the print media are boring. For example, the president
notices that a majority of voters now think invading Iraq was a mistake, so he
makes an address to the nation to drum up support. Where is the man bites dog
in that? I didn&rsquo;t hear the speech, but I could probably tell you exactly what
he said. A speech like that is, in the most literal sense, not news: there is
nothing new in it.</p>
<p>Nor is there anything new, except the names and places, in most &ldquo;news&rdquo; about
things going wrong. A child is abducted; there&rsquo;s a tornado; a ferry sinks;
someone gets bitten by a shark; a small plane crashes. And what do you learn
about the world from these stories? Absolutely nothing. They&rsquo;re outlying data
points; what makes them gripping also makes them irrelevant.</p>
<p>As in software, when professionals produce such crap, it&rsquo;s not surprising if
amateurs can do better. Live by the channel, die by the channel: if you depend
on an oligopoly, you sink into bad habits that are hard to overcome when you
suddenly get competition.</p>

I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about this, actually; it was not a casual remark. I think
the fundamental question is not whether the government pays for schools or
medicine, but whether you allow people to get rich.</p>
<p>In England in the 1970s, the top income tax rate was 98%. That’s what the
Beatles&rsquo; song 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxman">“Tax Man”</a> is referring to
when they say “one for you, nineteen for me.”</p>
<p>Any country that makes this choice ends up losing net, because new technology
tends to be developed by people trying to make their fortunes. It’s too much
work for anyone to do for ordinary wages. Smart people might work on sexy
projects like fighter planes and space rockets for ordinary wages, but
semiconductors or light bulbs or the

  <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html">plumbing</a> of e-commerce probably have to
be developed by entrepreneurs. Life in the Soviet Union would have been even
poorer if they hadn’t had American technologies to copy.</p>
<p>Finland is sometimes given as an example of a prosperous socialist country,
but apparently the combined top tax rate is 55%, only 5% higher than in
California. So if they seem that much more socialist than the US, it is
probably simply because they don&rsquo;t spend so much on their military.</p>

I think the most important of the new principles business has to learn is that
people work a lot harder on stuff they like. Well, that&rsquo;s news to no one. So
how can I claim business has to learn it? When I say business doesn&rsquo;t know
this, I mean the structure of business doesn&rsquo;t reflect it.</p>
<p>Business still reflects an older model, exemplified by the French word for
working: <em>travailler</em>. It has an English cousin, travail, and what it means is
torture.</p>
<p>This turns out not to be the last word on work, however. As societies get
richer, they learn something about work that&rsquo;s a lot like what they learn
about diet. We know now that the healthiest diet is the one our peasant
ancestors were forced to eat because they were poor. Like rich food, idleness
only seems desirable when you don&rsquo;t get enough of it. I think we were designed
to work, just as we were designed to eat a certain amount of fiber, and we
feel bad if we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a name for people who work for the love of it: amateurs. The word now
has such bad connotations that we forget its etymology, though it&rsquo;s staring us
in the face. &ldquo;Amateur&rdquo; was originally rather a complimentary word. But the
thing to be in the twentieth century was professional, which amateurs, by
definition, are not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the business world was so surprised by one lesson from open source:
that people working for love often surpass those working for money. Users
don&rsquo;t switch from Explorer to Firefox because they want to hack the source.
They switch because it&rsquo;s a better browser.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that Microsoft isn&rsquo;t trying. They know controlling the browser is one
of the keys to retaining their monopoly. The problem is the same they face in
operating systems: they can&rsquo;t pay people enough to build something better than
a group of inspired hackers will build for free.</p>
<p>I suspect professionalism was always overrated&ndash; not just in the literal sense
of working for money, but also connotations like formality and detachment.
Inconceivable as it would have seemed in, say, 1970, I think professionalism
was largely a fashion, driven by conditions that happened to exist in the
twentieth century.</p>

By conventional standards, Jobs and Wozniak were marginal people too.
Obviously they were smart, but they can&rsquo;t have looked good on paper. They were
at the time a pair of college dropouts with about three years of school
between them, and hippies to boot. Their previous business experience
consisted of making &ldquo;blue boxes&rdquo; to hack into the phone system, a business
with the rare distinction of being both illegal and unprofitable.</p>

Because there are 100x more drones than hackers, most new commercial
technologies are aimed at them. You have to learn to quickly identify which
tools are and aren&rsquo;t meant for you.</p>
<p>Any technology that has the outward features of Java (hype, accessibility,
committee design, ulterior commercial motives, &hellip;) is probably designed for
drones, so avoid it for the same reason you would avoid a novel with Fabio on
the cover, or an inn that advertises parking for trucks. They may be right for
their target audience. They may be created by smart people. They&rsquo;re just not
meant for you.</p>

One of the most powerful of those was the existence of &ldquo;channels.&rdquo;
Revealingly, the same term was used for both products and information: there
were distribution channels, and TV and radio channels.</p>
<p>It was the narrowness of such channels that made professionals seem so
superior to amateurs. There were only a few jobs as professional journalists,
for example, so competition ensured the average journalist was fairly good.
Whereas anyone can express opinions about current events in a bar. And so the
average person expressing his opinions in a bar sounds like an idiot compared
to a journalist writing about the subject.</p>
<p>On the Web, the barrier for publishing your ideas is even lower. You don&rsquo;t
have to buy a drink, and they even let kids in. Millions of people are
publishing online, and the average level of what they&rsquo;re writing, as you might
expect, is not very good. This has led some in the media to conclude that
blogs don&rsquo;t present much of a threat&ndash; that blogs are just a fad.</p>
<p>Actually, the fad is the word &ldquo;blog,&rdquo; at least the way the print media now use
it. What they mean by &ldquo;blogger&rdquo; is not someone who publishes in a weblog
format, but anyone who publishes online. That&rsquo;s going to become a problem as
the Web becomes the default medium for publication. So I&rsquo;d like to suggest an
alternative word for someone who publishes online. How about &ldquo;writer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those in the print media who dismiss the writing online because of its low
average quality are missing an important point: no one reads the average blog.
In the old world of channels, it meant something to talk about average
quality, because that&rsquo;s what you were getting whether you liked it or not. But
now you can read any writer you want. So the average quality of writing online
isn&rsquo;t what the print media are competing against. They&rsquo;re competing against
the best writing online. And, like Microsoft, they&rsquo;re losing.</p>
