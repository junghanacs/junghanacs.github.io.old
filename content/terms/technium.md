{{< hint warning >}}
The technium is a superorganism of technology. It has its own force that it
exerts. That force is part cultural (influenced by and influencing of humans),
but it's also partly non-human, partly indigenous to the physics of technology
itself.

Kevin Kelly is the founding executive editor of Wired magazine, and a former
editor/publisher of the Whole Earth Review. He has also been a writer,
photographer, conservationist, and student of Asian and digital culture.
